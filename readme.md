# Ferrous
A blazing fast Minecraft Server backend, written in Rust.

## Why Rust?
Rust is just faster than Java. On top of that, features like built-in async functions and compiler-level memory safety make it the best low-level language to write a server in.

## What about my plugins?
Unfortunately, not every change is an easy one to make. Paper or Bukkit based plugins are almost impossible to support because of Java's differences to Rust. On the upside, both Rust and JavaScript APIs will be availible for developers, alongside a suite of basic plugins provided by the Ferrous team.

## Why should I switch?
Need a server for your hub world? Your anarchy server? Want to have hundreds of concurrent players? Ferrous is built for that.
